I'm going to add a detailed description to the code in the notebooks so that everyone can improve my result ))

# Notebooks for Spaceship Titanic competition
## Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension

[Competition on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic)  
Notebooks on Kaggle (not available yet)

*"In this competition your task is to predict whether a passenger was transported to an alternate dimension during the Spaceship Titanic's collision with the spacetime anomaly. To help you make these predictions, you're given a set of personal records recovered from the ship's damaged computer system".*

**Dataset:**  
personal records for about two-thirds (~8700) of the passengers, to be used as training data.

**Steps to submit:**
- [exploration analysis along with data preparation](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Nanobelka/Spaceship_Titanic/blob/main/spaceship_1_EDA.ipynb);
- [model comparison with LazyPredict](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Nanobelka/Spaceship_Titanic/blob/main/spaceship_2_LazyPredict.ipynb);
- [final model training and submit prepare](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Nanobelka/Spaceship_Titanic/blob/main/spaceship_3_Model_and_Submit.ipynb).

**Result:**  
**130**th place out of about 2.5K participants in the "Spaceship Titanic" machine learning competition.
